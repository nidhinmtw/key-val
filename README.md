# key-val
A simple key value paired in memory data store that follows the Javascript object format. It supports persistence to file also.
This can be a simple stand-in to control your JS based data stores with file system backup for the data.

This is a work in progress. Yet to give any substantial codde additions, but soon it will get to its feet.
